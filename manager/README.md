# Hivemind #

Hivemind is an interface for managing different swarm simulations and collecting
results. It's called Hivemind because I made it so I can name it whatever I
want and it doesn't have to stand for anything.

Hivemind is basically a front end for starting the simulator with all the right
options, plus a few nice extra features for data collection
